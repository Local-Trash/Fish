# Fish
Fish is a 2d rust game engine built on [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs). This is a simple game engine made for internal projects of KeyCap Studio :thumbsup:. Sadly, we will probably not make any in depth tutorials for the engine. We will also not post this onto crates.io. 

## Dependency
First, because we aren't going to post this onto crates you need to link it to this github repo. 
```toml
[dependencies]
fish = { path = "https://github.com/Local-Trash/Fish.git" }
```
This links cargo to the library.
